Day 1 (Sep 15, 2025)

Achievements:
- Rebuilt project skeleton from scratch.
- Created frontend (React + Vite) with Dockerfile.
- Created 3 FastAPI services (orders-api, payments-api, catalog-api) each with health endpoint + Dockerfiles.
- Created ai-worker (simple Python background task) + Dockerfile.
- Created shared/ placeholder for future libraries.
- Created docker-compose.dev.yml to run all services together.
- Verified services:
  - orders-api → http://localhost:8081/health
  - payments-api → http://localhost:8082/health
  - catalog-api → http://localhost:8083/health
  - frontend → http://localhost:3000
  - ai-worker → logs confirm running
- Resolved networking/port conflicts by removing orphan containers.

Next steps (Day 2):
- Add real business logic to APIs (orders, payments, catalog).
- Connect frontend to APIs (fetch data, display).
- Introduce persistence (SQLite or Postgres).
- Add logging, metrics, monitoring.
- Prepare production docker-compose & Helm templates.
